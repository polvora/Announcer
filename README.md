##### an_redirecturl
Now the redirect URL is just an URL pointing to a site hosting [r.html](https://bitbucket.org/Polvora/announcer/downloads/r.html) which function is to receive the server IP, Port and Password as GET parameters and redirect the user to the server with a Steam Browser Protocol request (steam://connect/...), the reason to do this is because Steam doesn't allow Steam redirects inside its own site, it's dumb i know.  

For example if you host r.html in your dropbox public folder, you would have:

    an_redirecturl "https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/69397859/r.html"

Then in the announcement description the "Click Here to Join" link:

    https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/69397859/r.html?ip=233.143.43.54&port=27015

And finally this page, would redirect you to the server:

    steam://connect/233.143.43.54:27015/

### Install
##### Requirements
* [A working version of Sourcemod](http://www.sourcemod.net/downloads.php).
* [SteamCore library plugin](https://github.com/polvora/SteamCore).

_**DON'T FORGET TO SETUP STEAMCORE**_  
When you fulfil the requirements, just install as any other plugin, copy announcer.smx inside the plugins folder in your sourcemod directory.

### Download
Compiled versions: [announcer.smx](https://github.com/polvora/Announcer/releases).

If you want to compile the code yourself you have to add the include file `steamcore.inc` (from SteamCore, duh) inside `scripting/include` and then compile. _(You can't use includes with the online compiler)_

### Known Bugs
* When a profile name contains a website its not displayed, instead just the profile permalink is displayed. This happens beacuase there can not be an URL inside an URL, and i can't do anything about it.
